    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a committed programmer proficient in multiple languages including C, Python, HTML5, CSS, and 
      JavaScript. With a background in electronic engineering, I possess a deep understanding of computers,
       enabling me to develop highly optimized and efficient code.    
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      My high school education emphasized project-based learning, providing me with extensive experience in
      collaborative project environments. I excel as a team player and readily assume leadership
      responsibilities in the absence of a clear hierarchy. While I take initiative, I also recognize my
      limitations and am open to stepping back to learn from experienced mentors whom I view as invaluable
      guides in my professional development.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Simon Says (2019)</h3>
        <p>
          Having already grasped the fundamentals of programming prior to joining E.T.R.R., I was motivated to
           further expand my skill set by delving into new languages. Alongside a friend, I embarked on learning 
           C and subsequently developed a randomized version of Simon Says during our second year (at age 13). 
           This project garnered significant attention and was showcased at the 2019 TedEd Talks, where it received
            overwhelmingly positive feedback.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Basketball Hoop (2020)</h3>
        <p>
          As my interest in basketball was budding just before the onset of the pandemic, I found myself 
          drawn to the sport. However, with the sudden explosion of COVID-19 and subsequent quarantine measures
           in Argentina, I realized the importance of finding alternative avenues to continue my personal and 
           professional development.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>TedEd Talk</h3>
        <p>
          During my fourth year at school, I was presented with the opportunity to deliver a TED-Ed Talk. 
          Despite the unfortunate circumstance of having to present it online, I embraced the challenge 
          wholeheartedly. My talk centered around the concept of viewing obstacles as opportunities, drawing
          upon the example of the basketball hoop project I had recently completed. It was a nerve-wracking
          experience, but one that allowed me to share valuable insights with my audience.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>N.A.R.F. (2021)</h3>
        <p>
          In collaboration with my closest friends, we embarked on a project to create our own version of a 
          NERF gun, inspired by the high cost of commercial models and our burgeoning interest in electronics.
          Drawing upon our classroom lessons on the potential of electronic components like DC motors, we leveraged 
          our basic knowledge to design and construct our own knockoff version.
          it.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>NewVision (2022)</h3>
        <p>
          As the global pandemic drew to a close, the limitations faced by disabled individuals, particularly the 
          visually impaired, became glaringly apparent in our daily lives. Motivated by a desire to address these 
          challenges, we embarked on the development of an electronic device aimed at enhancing accessibility and 
          safety. The project comprised three key stages: sensor implementation, processing facilitated by a discrete 
          electronic circuit, and the integration of an alert system to notify users of potential hazards. 
          Collaborating closely with the Asociacion Argentina de Ciegos (A.S.A.C.), we were able to leverage 
          their expertise and insights to ensure the device met the specific needs of the visually impaired 
          community.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Basketball Scoreboard (2023)</h3>
        <p>
          Driven by our shared passion for basketball and the desire to enhance our school's sporting events, my 
          friends and I identified a critical need: the absence of a functional scoreboard on our school court. 
          Recognizing the opportunity to make a significant contribution, we enthusiastically took on the challenge 
          of designing and implementing a basketball scoreboard from scratch.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Ecodesafio (2023)</h3>
        <p>
          In 2023, I participated in the Y.P.F. 
          Ecodesafio as a member of the electronics division, an experience that significantly enriched 
          my skill set and teamwork abilities. Within our division, comprising just three members, we were 
          tasked with developing a sophisticated system aimed at optimizing vehicle performance based on 
          battery levels. My role focused on designing and implementing sensor circuits and power electronics, 
          while my colleagues focused on creating a neural network to analyze the data I collected. This 
          collaborative effort taught me the importance of coordination and synergy within a team, and the 
          value of leveraging diverse skills to achieve a common goal.
